# double-pendulum-impulses-and-collisions
Numerical simulation and animation of a 2-link pendulum after the action of an impulse.
 The equations of motion are derived using symbolic toolbox in the script 'derive_eqns'.
 Run the 'simulate-1' function to see the animation.
 The impulse variation had been verified by plotting total energy plot.
Working on collisions with a static obstacle.
